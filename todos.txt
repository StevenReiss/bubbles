1)  BubletRepository.java li=148: null pointer: need to handle user remote
files

2)  Text editor open remote file options

3)  Copy test from editor (local) in client doesn't support paste to BALE
editor (remote) on server.

4)  Default workspace on the client still bad -- need to set default_workspace
for all uses

5)  Seede times out too soon

6)  Breakpoints don't seem to be saved much of the time.  Perhaps Eclipse is
exiting abnormally.  Is there a way of forcing breakpoints to be saved to disk?

XXX Goto Source for constructor call from stack view fails?

8)  How to put back DDT control window (key that checks if present and
recreates if not?; don't allow deletion?)

XXX Select word inside string shouldn't select the whole string

10) Bad working directory in the command line for new project causes BDOC to
   abort (update default_workspace). This generates a Bad board setup error.

???  Debug panel is sometimes missing after startup

???  -cloud not remembered after download of new version

???  Text search limited to project

14)  Data display of large arrays

15)  Cut and paste into evaluation window.  Also history features

16) Sometime it says getting cloud information, but never puts up dialog box

17) Sometimes the group doesn't go away when the bubble does (white shadow
group left)

??? Plugins not updated when bubbles is updated.

???  F3/F4 should use pointed to, not selection

???  No logging of file queries.  File queries can be missing. (or just message missing)

21)  Changing launch configuration name doesn't update repository

22)  Debug can't open Jfram on mac inside bubbles (SWT library and Eclipse hidden flag)

???  Removing all debug channels should go back to main view, not debug view.
