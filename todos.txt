1)  BubletRepository.java li=148: null pointer: need to handle user remote files

2)  Text editor open remote file options

3)  Copy test from editor (local) in client doesn't support paste to BALE editor (remote) on server.

4)  Default workspace on the client still bad -- need to set default_workspace for all uses

5)  Seede times out too soon

6)  Breakpoints don't seem to be saved much of the time.  Perhaps Eclipse is exiting abnormally.  Is there a
        way of forcing breakpoints to be saved to disk?

7)  Goto Source for constructor call from stack view fails?

8)  How to put back DDT control window (key that checks if present and recreates if not?; don't allow deletion?)

9)  Select word inside string shouldn't select the whole string

10) Bad working directory in the command line for new project causes BDOC to abort (update default_workspace).
        This generates a Bad board setup error.

11)  Debug panel is sometimes missing after startup

12)  -cloud not remembered after download of new version
