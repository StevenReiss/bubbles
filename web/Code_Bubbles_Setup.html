<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Welcome
to Code Bubbles</span></h1>
Here are some instructions on getting set to use Code Bubbles for the
first time.<br>
<br>
<h2>Setting Up Code Bubbles</h2>
<br>
Code Bubbles should have brought up two windows.&nbsp; The one in the
center of your screen is a simple splash screen that shows what part of
initialization is currently underway.&nbsp; Since initialization
involves ensuring projects are up-to-date, downloading symbols, and
getting documentation set up, it can take a minute or two on longer
projects, so the splash screen is just telling you to be patient.<br>
<br>
The other window is probably in the upper left hand corner of your
display.&nbsp; It is requesting some basic information that the system
needs in order to run.&nbsp; This information is only requested once
and then is saved in files in the .bubbles directory inside your home
directory.<br>
<br>
The first field to be filled in in this window is the Eclipse
Installation Directory.&nbsp; This should be the directory that
contains the eclipse binary as well as the Eclipse plugins (or dropins)
directory.&nbsp; If you don't have Eclipse installed yet, you should
install it first and then rerun bubbles.&nbsp; If you have Eclipse
installed, browse to and then select that directory.<br>
<br>
The next field asks if you want to have bubbles automatically
update.&nbsp; (This field is omitted in the educational version of the
system).&nbsp; Automatic updates are checked when the system starts and
are downloaded and installed at that point if a new version of the
system exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is
recommended that you check this box</span>. <br>
<br>
The next field asks if you want to run Eclipse in foreground or
not.&nbsp; Bubbles gives you the option of running both Eclipse and
Code Bubbles or just Code Bubbles.&nbsp; If you run them both, they
should cooperate (i.e. edits in one should be reflected immediately by
edits in the other).&nbsp; Note that this option has not been tested
that extensively.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> It is
recommended that you do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
check this box. </span><br>
<br>
Once you have selected an appropriate version of Eclipse, the button at
the bottom labeled <span style="font-style: italic;">Install Bubbles</span>
will become active.&nbsp; Clicking this will cause bubbles to install
its Eclipse plugin into your Eclipse installation.&nbsp; This is
necessary before Code Bubbles can be run.&nbsp; Note that Eclipse
should not be running when you click on this.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once Code Bubbles is installed in your version of Eclipse and you have
made your selections above, you can click on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">OK </span>button to proceed with Code
Bubbles initialization.<br>
<br>
<h2>Choosing a Workspace</h2>
Code Bubbles uses Eclipse to manage workspaces, projects, files,
compilation, debugging, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in order to run it needs
to know what Eclipse workspace it should connect to.<br>
<br>
Code Bubbles thus should pop up another dialog box (again in the
upper-left hand corner of the screen) asking you to select the
appropriate workspace. If you have an existing Eclipse workspace for
which you want to use Code Bubbles, simply select the corresponding
Eclipse workspace at this point.&nbsp; (This is the workspace that
Eclipse would ask for when it starts up).&nbsp; Code Bubbles will
automatically provide you with access to all projects, launch
configurations, etc. for that workspace.<br>
<br>
There are two check boxes in this dialog.&nbsp; The first will cause
the system to create a new workspace at the provided path.&nbsp; This
will cause Code Bubbles to ask you to define a project when it actually
initializes since the system needs to have&nbsp; workspace with at
least one project.&nbsp; (Actually, it will ask Eclipse to ask you to
define a project.)&nbsp; The second button lets you decide if this
dialog should always come up or if the system should just start working
on whatever workspace was last used.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once you click OK in this dialog Code Bubbles will finish
initialization.&nbsp; Note that the first time that the system
initializes might take longer than expected since Code Bubbles wants to
download indices into the available JavaDoc documentation.&nbsp; This
information is cached so that later initializations should be
significantly faster.<br>
